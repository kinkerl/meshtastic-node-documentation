# Opinions in this configuration:
# * This is for a fixed position node. You have to set lat, long and alt
# * This assumes you are using a power measurement hardware (see meshhessen.de community node)
# * It sets the meshhessen.de MQTT server
# * Embraces MQTT and allows sending and receiving via MQTT
# * Deactivates the heartbeat LED to save power
